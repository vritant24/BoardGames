TicTacToe:

`n_game.py` is the file to start working from. The code runs and lets user see how the out put is.

- The implementation doesn't contain any error checking, there is no end game condition. (ectries can also be overwritten)
- The students should rewrite the functions and add more
    - While displaying the grid, indicate row and column index
    - Allow user to enter more natural numbers (1 indexed instead of 0 indexed)
    - Print which player's turn it is
    - Add check for when game is over
    - And error check for inputs

- A complete game is in n_game_complete.py

- Concepts used:
    - Variables
    - conditionals
    - basic I/O
    - functions
    - loops
    - 2D arrays
